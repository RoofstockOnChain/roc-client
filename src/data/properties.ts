      'Roofstock onChain simplifies how single-family residential properties are bought, owned and sold. We operate a marketplace that allows purchase and sale of single-family properties using blockchain technology. When you buy a Home onChain, you instantly receive a token in your crypto wallet that represents the sole ownership of an LLC that has title to an underlying property.  This token is associated with a Home onChain that is a newly renovated three bedroom, two and a half bath. The main level features all updated flooring, a combination of wood laminate, and tile. The galley-style kitchen includes updated appliances and sliding glass door access to the walkout patio.  The sprawling primary suite comes equipped with a double vanity, soaking tub, and huge walk-in closet. Less than a 5 minute drive to restaurants, groceries, Walmart, Lowes, and more.
